pebbleSineWatch
===============

Displays a sine wave on the screen.  

###To read:
The number of nodes is the number of hours, not counting the one at the bottom of the screen.  That is to say, the number of times the wave crosses the middle of the screen.  At one o'clock, there is only half a cycle showing.

The number of minutes is shown by looking at the top end of the wave.  The antinodes, places furthest from the middle of the screen, is 30 minutes.  Zero minutes is at the most recent node.  60 minutes is at the next node that isn't shown yet.
