pebbleSineWatch
===============

Displays a sine wave on the screen.  

###To read:
The number of antinodes is the number of hours.  That is to say, the number of times the wave gets close to the edge.  At one o'clock, there is only half a cycle showing.

The number of minutes is shown by looking at the top end of the wave.  The middle of the screen is 30 minutes.  Zero minutes is at the most recent antinode.  60 minutes is at the next antinode that isn't shown yet.
